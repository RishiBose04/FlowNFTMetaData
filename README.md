# FlowNFTMetaData

## Overview

This project is a smart contract for creating and managing an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The contract allows users to create, deposit, transfer, and now, borrow authenticated NFTs. Additionally, a script has been provided to display the metadata for a specific NFT ID.

2. **Create and Deposit NFTs:** Users can mint new NFTs and deposit them into the collection.

3. **Transfer NFTs:** NFTs within the collection can be transferred between users.

4. **Borrow Authenticated NFTs:** The contract now includes a new function called `borrowAuthNFT` which allows users to borrow authenticated NFTs and their Metadatas.
